#This is the transformation catalog.
#
#It comes pre-configured with a number of simple transformations with
#paths that are likely to work on a linux box. However, on some systems,
#the paths to these executables will be different (for example, sometimes
#some of these programs are found in /usr/bin rather than in /bin)
#
#NOTE WELL: fields in this file must be separated by tabs, not spaces; and
#there must be no trailing whitespace at the end of each line.
